AMES PIPELINE 500-IMAGE DATASET PREPARATION PROCESS SUMMARY
================================================================================
Date: September 14, 2025
Project: AMES Image Retrieval Pipeline
Repository: ames (michaelscheinfeild/ames)

================================================================================
1. INITIAL PROBLEM DISCOVERY
================================================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Main AMES pipeline showing 0% precision (completely irrelevant retrieval results)
- Gallery features and pipeline extraction were misaligned
- Need to debug and fix the feature/model mismatch

ROOT CAUSE:
- Original gallery features extracted with different settings/model than pipeline
- Binarization parameter inconsistency between extraction and inference
- HDF5 structured array handling issues

================================================================================
2. PHASE 1: DATASET SUBSET CREATION (500 Images)
================================================================================

PURPOSE: Create manageable subset for faster debugging and iteration

STEP 1: Created setup_500_dataset.py
--------------------------------------
FUNCTION: Extract first 500 images from full 70K+ dataset
INPUT FILES:
- data/roxford5k/test_gallery.txt (70,000+ images)
- data/roxford5k/gnd_roxford5k.pkl (full ground truth)

OUTPUT FILES:
- data/roxford5k/test_gallery_500.txt (500 image names)
- data/roxford5k/gnd_roxford5k_500.pkl (500-image ground truth)

KEY OPERATIONS:
- Read original gallery list
- Select first 500 images
- Filter ground truth data for 500-image subset
- Preserve query structure and relationships

STEP 2: Created create_500_features.py
-------------------------------------
FUNCTION: Extract 500-image subset from original HDF5 features
INPUT FILES:
- data/roxford5k/dinov2_gallery_local.hdf5 (70K+ features)

OUTPUT FILES:
- data/roxford5k/dinov2_gallery_local_500.hdf5 (500 features subset)

KEY OPERATIONS:
- Load original HDF5 structured array
- Extract first 500 entries
- Maintain original data structure and format
- Verify shape and data integrity

================================================================================
3. PHASE 2: FEATURE RE-EXTRACTION (Critical Fix)
================================================================================

PURPOSE: Re-extract gallery features using exact same pipeline as query processing

COMMAND EXECUTED:
python extract/extract_descriptors.py 
    --config conf/descriptors/dinov2.yaml 
    --dataset_config conf/dataset/test_dataset.yaml 
    --gallery_list data/roxford5k/test_gallery_500.txt 
    --output_file data/roxford5k/dinov2_gallery_500_local.hdf5

CRITICAL IMPORTANCE:
- Uses identical extraction pipeline as query processing
- Ensures feature/model alignment
- Eliminates preprocessing inconsistencies
- Addresses binarization parameter alignment

OUTPUT:
- data/roxford5k/dinov2_gallery_500_local.hdf5 (properly aligned features)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- DINOv2 ViT-Base backbone
- Spatial attention module
- Consistent preprocessing and normalization
- Proper patch size quantization

================================================================================
4. PHASE 3: VERIFICATION & COMPARISON
================================================================================

STEP 1: Created inspect_hdf5.py
------------------------------
FUNCTION: Verify HDF5 file integrity and compare formats

FILES INSPECTED:
- dinov2_gallery_local_500.hdf5 (subset from original 70K)
- dinov2_gallery_500_local.hdf5 (re-extracted with proper pipeline)

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
- Both files: correct shapes (500, 700, 773)
- Data types: float32 
- Structure: Last 768 dimensions are descriptors
- Subset integrity: Confirmed proper data extraction

STEP 2: Created diagnostic scripts
---------------------------------
FILES CREATED:
- src/query_diagnostic.py (compares pipeline results with ground truth)
- Integration into main pipeline for real-time diagnostics

DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITIES:
- Precision calculation
- Ground truth comparison
- Relevance scoring
- Visual result analysis

================================================================================
5. PHASE 4: TESTING & RESULTS COMPARISON
================================================================================

STEP 1: Created test_pipeline_500.py
-----------------------------------
PURPOSE: Test with original 500-image subset
USES: dinov2_gallery_local_500.hdf5 (subset from 70K images)
RESULTS: Poor performance due to feature/model mismatch

STEP 2: Created test_pipeline_500_new.py
---------------------------------------
PURPOSE: Test with newly extracted features
USES: dinov2_gallery_500_local.hdf5 (re-extracted with proper pipeline)
RESULTS: 24% precision - SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT!

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
- Original features: 0% precision (completely wrong results)
- Re-extracted features: 24% precision (correct matches in top results)
- Improvement factor: ∞ (from 0% to 24%)

================================================================================
7. KEY TECHNICAL INSIGHTS DISCOVERED
================================================================================

FEATURE EXTRACTION ALIGNMENT:
- Gallery features must use identical extraction pipeline as query processing
- Preprocessing steps must be perfectly aligned
- Model parameters (especially binarization) must match
- Spatial attention and normalization must be consistent

BINARIZATION IMPACT:
- binarized=False vs binarized=True significantly affects results
- Must be consistent between gallery extraction and query processing
- Current hypothesis: binarized=True may further improve the 24% precision

HDF5 STRUCTURED ARRAYS:
- Original format: structured arrays with multiple fields
- New format: simple 3D arrays (images, patches, features)
- Last 768 dimensions contain the actual descriptors
- Proper indexing: data[..., -768:] for descriptor extraction

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- Precision calculation based on ground truth matching
- Easy/Hard positive categories in ground truth
- Junk image filtering for accurate evaluation

================================================================================
8. CURRENT STATE & NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

CURRENT PERFORMANCE:
- Baseline (mismatched): 0% precision
- Aligned features: 24% precision
- Target: Further improvement through binarization optimization

REMAINING HYPOTHESIS:
- Setting binarized=True in AMES model may improve results
- Need to test both:
  1. Pipeline with binarized=True
  2. Re-extract gallery features with binarized=True if needed

NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Modify AMES model instantiation to use binarized=True
2. Test pipeline with current re-extracted features
3. If needed, re-extract gallery features with binarized=True
4. Compare performance across all configurations

END OF SUMMARY
================================================================================

This document provides a complete record of the systematic approach used to
debug and improve the AMES image retrieval pipeline, transforming it from
0% to 24% precision through careful feature/model alignment and data preparation.

The 500-image subset approach proved invaluable for rapid iteration and
debugging, allowing us to identify and fix the core feature extraction
alignment issues efficiently.
